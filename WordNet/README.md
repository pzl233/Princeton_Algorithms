WordNet is a semantic lexicon for the English language that groups words into sets of synonyms called synsets. It describes semantic relationships between synsets. One such relationship is the is-a relationship, which connects a hyponym (more specific synset) to a hypernym (more general synset). This implementation uses a rooted DAG(Directed acyclic graph).
